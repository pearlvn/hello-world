This application uses vagrant to install mongoDB and then create a DB called catalyst. It then creates a collection called catalystDocs and populates it with an initial document. mongo.sh shell script is used for the above.
The application then installs python3.4, pip3.4, pythonvenv and flask. It then creates a Flask.py application to run flask on port 8080. Flask.sh script is used for the above.
TBD - Flask form parsing functions and momgoDB update functions.
